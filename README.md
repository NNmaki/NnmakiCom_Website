This small project is part of the Scrimba Front End Developer Path. This JavaScript application keeps track of the scores in a basketball game based on user inputs. User can add 1, 2, or 3 points to either the home or guest side.

Ive also added some "extra features," such as a timer for periods, a highlighted leading team, and some popup windows.

Feel free to try it out: https://nnmaki.com/scoreboard/
